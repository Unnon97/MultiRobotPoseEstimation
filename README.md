# MultiRobotPoseEstimation
Generating Synthetic dataset for custom scenario using Nvidia IsaacSim for training PoseCNN algorithm.
1. Using 3D models of object/robots in Universal Scene Descriptor(USD) format
2. Developing custom Offline Pose Generator code along with a customized YCBVideoWriter to get the datasets
3. Inputting the dataset, camera parameters and 3D models for PoseCNN algorithm inside its Docker Container
